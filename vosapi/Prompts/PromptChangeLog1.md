## 2) OTP design request
User:
"You are a senior full-stack architect specializing in OTP-based authentication using Spring Boot (Java 17) on the backend and Angular on the frontend.

I need guidance on designing OTP login for my application.
Use case:

When a user opens the application, they must authenticate using an OTP.

The backend sends an OTP to the user's email.

The user enters the OTP in the UI.

The system validates the OTP and, if correct, redirects the user to the next page.

Please explain where each part of the OTP logic should be implemented (backend vs frontend), and describe the correct architecture, security considerations, API design, and recommended workflow."
