## Next steps (suggested, low-risk)

- Create `Prompts/summary-2025-11-15.md` (this file) — DONE.
- Create a small `Prompts/changelog-2025-11-15.md` that links to the raw prompt files if you want verbatim copies.
- For OTP: produce a single-file example (Spring Boot controller + service) and a minimal Angular form to demonstrate full flow.
- For onboarding: implement document upload endpoints, storage strategy (S3/local), and a schema for associating documents with vendor records.
- For Postgres timeout: collect runtime env details (JDBC URL, security group, network ACLs) and test connectivity (telnet/nc) from EC2 to the DB host.

If you'd like, I can now:
- open this new file for editing, or
- generate the verbatim changelog with full prompt text, or
- implement one of the suggested follow-ups (OTP example, document handling, or Postgres diagnostics).
